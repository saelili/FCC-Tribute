                    <p class="intro">Caroline Earle White was a dedicated activist and advocate for animals in a time when the movement for humane treatment was just beginning to take form. She had always been disturbed by the treatment of work horses in Philadelphia, and after meeting with early animal advocates she co-founded the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in 1867. Despite being a founder she was not permitted to hold a leadership role as a woman and so went on to found its women’s branch in 1869. Guided by an all-female board of directors, the Women’s Pennsylvania SPCA soon became a force in the humane community through campaigns and legislation combined with direct care for local animals.</p>
                    <p class="intro">White continued her work in animal advocacy throughout her life and kept her position as president of the WPSPCA until her death at the age of 83. She was also involved in literary societies, women’s suffrage, and worked with organizations that helped the poor obtain medical services. Her achievements encouraged women to pursue roles in society typically occupied by men. </p> <img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dlwlrqajz/image/upload/c_scale,w_234/v1458856317/orn006_sq3jsl.png" class="img-responsive center-block icon-img"></img>

Caroline called on her members to boycott cruel carriage horse companies and even go as far as to citizen arrest malicious drivers. In 1909, the group, along with other city humanitarians, secured legislation forbidding the sale or purchase of disabled work horses.</p>

The move toward this legislation came about when organization became aware of inhumane treatment of animals in transport. Under her leadership, the Women’s PSPCA stationed agents at specific locations along the major railroad routes to observe how the animals were handled. They kept records by telegraphing back to headquarters what they observed on the rail lines. Eventually they had a strong enough case to take the Reading Railroad to court in 1896 for transporting a shipment of horses over a 52-hour period without ever stopping to feed them or give them water. They won their case and in 1907 were able to pass legislation that mandated that animals be fed and watered after 28 hours in transit. Fines and convictions of various train lines followed and the legislation is still in place today.</div>
